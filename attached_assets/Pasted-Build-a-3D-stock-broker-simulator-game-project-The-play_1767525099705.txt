Build a 3D stock broker simulator game project. The player works as a broker and builds a stock portfolio day-by-day. Use ONLY fictional companies/tickers and fictional price data (no real company names, logos, or historical charts). Add a “New Client Capital” button that generates money to trade with.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS
- No real company names, no real tickers, no real logos, no real market data.
- All prices and news are procedurally generated or fictional.
- Include a clear disclaimer in the UI: “All companies and market data are fictional.”
- Keep the project runnable in Replit (web). Use a browser-friendly 3D approach.

TECH STACK (use this)
- Use JavaScript/TypeScript + Three.js for 3D.
- Use Vite for dev server/build.
- Use a simple UI overlay (HTML/CSS) on top of the 3D scene for menus and trading.
- Persist game state locally using LocalStorage.

GAME OVERVIEW
The game is played in “days”.
Each day:
1) Start of day: show fictional news/events.
2) Player can buy/sell fictional stocks.
3) End of day: prices update, show P/L summary, reputation changes.
Repeat.

3D SCENE (simple but nice)
- A small 3D office scene: desk plane, monitor, keyboard blocks, chair block, soft lighting.
- Camera: slightly angled top-down / desk view.
- The monitor in 3D should visually exist, but UI interactions can be on the HTML overlay.
- Add subtle ambient light + directional light. Add a very mild bloom-like feel if easy, otherwise skip.

UI (HTML overlay)
Create these panels:
A) Top bar:
- Day number
- Cash
- Portfolio value
- Reputation (0–100)
- Career level (Junior, Associate, Senior, Partner)

B) Left panel: “Market”
- List of fictional stocks with:
  - Ticker, Company name, Sector
  - Current price
  - Daily change (+/- and %)
- Clicking a stock opens details in the right panel.

C) Right panel: “Trade”
- Selected stock details:
  - Price
  - Small sparkline chart (generated from last 30 fictional points)
  - Buttons: Buy / Sell
  - Quantity input
  - Show estimated cost/proceeds
- Show current position: shares owned + average cost.

D) Bottom panel: “Daily Feed”
- News/events and system messages (e.g. “New client onboarded…”)

E) End of Day modal:
- Summary: day P/L, biggest winner/loser, reputation change
- Button: “Next Day”

CORE MECHANICS
1) Fictional Stocks Universe
Create 12–15 fictional stocks. Use these (exact names/tickers):
1. NORDLITE SYSTEMS (NLSY) – Logistics software
2. VANTA CLOUDWORKS (VCLD) – Cloud infrastructure
3. KERNEL FORGE (KFRG) – Industrial cybersecurity
4. HALBERG INDUSTRIES (HLBG) – Factory automation components
5. AURORA GRID CO (AGCO) – Power distribution & grid services
6. SOLVEX MATERIALS (SLVX) – Battery materials tech
7. BRONZE HARBOR FINANCE (BHFN) – Regional finance
8. MINTBRIDGE PAYMENTS (MBPY) – Payments infrastructure
9. ORCHARD INSURE GROUP (OIGR) – Insurance
10. CIRRUS MEDICAL (CRMD) – Medtech devices
11. FJORD FRESH FOODS (FJFF) – Consumer foods
12. LUMINA RETAIL LABS (LRLB) – Retail analytics
13. SKYHARBOR MOBILITY (SHMB) – Urban mobility fleets
14. TIDEWAY SHIPPING (TWSH) – Shipping & logistics
15. PINNACLE TELECOM (PNTL) – Telecom services

2) Price Simulation (fictional)
- Initialize each stock with a starting price (e.g. 10–250).
- Each end-of-day update:
  - Apply random daily return based on volatility per stock (tech higher, utilities/telecom lower).
  - Apply an event modifier if a news event triggers.
- Keep a rolling price history array for each stock (at least 30 points) for the sparkline.

3) Portfolio & Trading
- Player starts with some cash (e.g. 100,000).
- Allow Buy/Sell:
  - Buy reduces cash, increases shares, updates average cost.
  - Sell increases cash, reduces shares; realized P/L tracked.
- Show total portfolio value = cash + sum(shares * currentPrice).
- Track daily P/L and total P/L.

4) New Client Capital Button (money generation)
Add a prominent button on the UI (top bar or market panel) labeled:
“New Client”
Rules:
- Gives additional cash once per in-game day (cooldown resets next day).
- Amount depends on career level:
  - Junior: +50,000
  - Associate: +250,000
  - Senior: +1,000,000
  - Partner: +5,000,000
- When clicked:
  - Add cash
  - Add a log message in “Daily Feed”:
    “New client onboarded. Capital added to account.”
  - Provide subtle feedback (button briefly highlights, optional small sound).
- Disable the button after use that day and show “Available tomorrow”.

5) Career Level & Reputation
- Reputation starts at 50.
- Update reputation at end of day based on daily P/L:
  - If day return positive: +1 to +3
  - If negative: -1 to -3
- Career level thresholds:
  - Junior: rep 0–59
  - Associate: rep 60–74
  - Senior: rep 75–89
  - Partner: rep 90–100
- Career level affects New Client Capital payouts.

6) Fictional News / Events
- Each day generate 1–3 news items:
  - Macro (rates, inflation) as flavor text
  - Sector news (shipping rates, battery subsidy, cyber incident)
  - Company-specific event for 0–2 tickers
- Events apply a temporary modifier to daily return for impacted tickers (positive or negative).
- Show news items in the Daily Feed at start of day.

PERSISTENCE
- Save and load:
  - day number
  - cash
  - positions
  - average costs
  - price history
  - reputation
  - whether New Client was used today
- Use localStorage. Provide “Reset Save” in a small settings menu.

DELIVERABLES
- Provide a complete Replit-ready project with:
  - package.json
  - Vite config
  - Three.js scene
  - UI overlay
  - Game state logic in clean modules/files
- Include a README with:
  - how to run (npm install, npm run dev)
  - controls
  - how the fictional market works
- Ensure it runs without errors and looks clean on mobile viewport too.

QUALITY NOTES
- Keep code readable.
- Use simple, consistent styling.
- Make sure the New Client Capital logic is bug-free and resets correctly each new day.
