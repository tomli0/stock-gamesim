Modify the News system so news does NOT appear every day. News should be random and occasional, but when it appears it must be relevant to the game’s fictional companies/tickers and/or sectors, and it must influence the market simulation.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Only use the game’s fictional companies/tickers and sectors (no real companies/data).
- News can mention fictional companies/tickers when it is company-specific.
- Do NOT show buy/sell recommendations.
- Do NOT show explicit impact labels (no bullish/bearish).
- Players must infer consequences.

GOAL:
Make news feel like occasional market catalysts, not constant daily filler.

--------------------------------------------------
1) RANDOM NEWS FREQUENCY (CORE CHANGE)
--------------------------------------------------

Instead of generating news every day, implement random generation with these probabilities:

- 35% of days: NO news at all (“Quiet day”)
- 40% of days: 1 news item
- 20% of days: 2 news items
- 5% of days: 3 news items (“Eventful day”)

Display:
- If no news today, the News tab should show a simple message:
  “Quiet day. No major headlines.”

--------------------------------------------------
2) TYPES OF NEWS (WHEN IT HAPPENS)
--------------------------------------------------

When news is generated, choose types with weighted randomness:

- Company news: 60%
- Sector news: 30%
- Macro news: 10%

Company News:
- Must reference exactly ONE fictional company (name + ticker) from the existing universe.
- Event types include:
  contracts, lawsuits/regulatory inquiry, product delay, earnings surprise, guidance change.

Sector News:
- Must reference a sector that exists in the game and affects multiple companies in that sector.
- Examples: chip shortages, shipping rates, interest rates affecting lenders, battery materials costs.

Macro News:
- Broad and rare; affects general volatility/drift.

--------------------------------------------------
3) RELEVANCE GUARANTEE
--------------------------------------------------

Ensure news ALWAYS maps to something that exists in-game:
- Company news targets a real in-game ticker.
- Sector news targets a real in-game sector with at least 2 companies assigned to it.
- If the game currently lacks sector mapping, create and maintain a sector field for each company.

--------------------------------------------------
4) MARKET IMPACT (HIDDEN)
--------------------------------------------------

Each news item creates a hidden effect object:
- type: company | sector | macro
- target: ticker / sector / market
- direction: positive | negative | volatilityIncrease
- strength: small | medium | large
- durationDays: 1–3 with decay

Impact guidelines:
- Company news: noticeable modifier (±2% to ±10% depending on strength).
- Sector news: moderate (±0.5% to ±4%).
- Macro news: small drift and/or volatility shift.

Do NOT show impact magnitude/direction labels in the UI.

--------------------------------------------------
5) NEWS TAB UI
--------------------------------------------------

- Keep the News tab as a scrollable list of cards.
- Each card shows:
  - Headline
  - Category badge: Company / Sector / Macro
  - Timestamp: “Morning Brief”
  - Body (2–4 sentences)
- If multiple items exist that day, show them in chronological order.
- If no items, show the “Quiet day” state.

Optional: Keep last 3 days of news accessible via a small dropdown:
- “Today / Yesterday / 2 days ago”
(If quick to implement; otherwise skip.)

--------------------------------------------------
6) END OF DAY INTEGRATION
--------------------------------------------------

- If there was news today, include a short line in End of Day summary:
  “Today’s headlines influenced market movement.”
- If no news today, do not mention news in the summary.

--------------------------------------------------
7) PERSISTENCE
--------------------------------------------------

Persist:
- Today’s news items (if any)
- Active effects with remaining duration
- Historical news (if implemented)

DELIVERABLE:
- News appears randomly and occasionally as described.
- All news is relevant to in-game companies/sectors.
- News influences the market internally without explicit hints.
- UI handles “no news” days cleanly.
