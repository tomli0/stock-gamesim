Add a “Lifestyle Shop” + “Trader Profile” system to the existing Idle + Trading game.

CRITICAL RULES
- The shop is cosmetic/status only. NO gameplay advantages:
  - No trading bonuses
  - No higher win rates
  - No direct income multipliers
  - No better prices
- Items are “luxury/status” (paintings, cars, watches, office decor).
- Items should be visible on a Profile screen and (optionally) reflected in the 3D office scene as simple props.
- Use ONLY in-game currency (cash). No real IAP implementation in Replit.
- Persist ownership and equipped items in localStorage.
- Keep UI mobile-friendly and consistent with the current dark theme.

GOAL
Create an addictive “numbers go up → buy luxury → show off your trader identity” loop without making the game pay-to-win.

--------------------------------------------
A) NEW SCREENS / NAVIGATION
--------------------------------------------

1) Add a new top-level navigation:
- Market / Trade (existing)
- News (existing if present)
- Boosts (existing if present)
- NEW: Profile
- NEW: Shop

If you use a responsive layout:
- On mobile: these are tabs or a compact top nav.
- On desktop: sidebar buttons or top nav.

--------------------------------------------
B) TRADER PROFILE SCREEN
--------------------------------------------

Create a “Profile” screen showing:

1) Identity
- Player name (editable)
- Current title (derived from career level)
- Optional tagline (editable)

2) Career & Performance
- Career level (Junior, Associate, PM, Senior PM, Partner)
- Reputation (0–100)
- Fund Size (AUM)
- Total net worth (cash + portfolio value)
- Best day / worst day stats (optional if already tracked)

3) Equipped Lifestyle Items (with slots)
- Watch slot (1 equipped)
- Car slot (1 equipped)
- Art slot (1 equipped)
- Office decor slot (1 equipped)

Each slot shows:
- Item image/icon
- Item name
- Rarity color (common/rare/epic/legendary)
- Button: “Change”

Include a simple “Inventory” section or “Manage” modal:
- list owned items by category
- Equip/Unequip buttons

--------------------------------------------
C) SHOP SCREEN (LIFESTYLE SHOP)
--------------------------------------------

Create a “Shop” screen with:

1) Categories (tabs or segmented control)
- Watches
- Cars
- Art
- Office

2) Shop item cards showing:
- Item name
- Category
- Price (cash)
- Rarity badge
- Short flavor description (1 line)
- Requirements (career gate):
  - e.g., “Requires Associate” / “Requires Senior PM”
- Purchase button:
  - Disabled if insufficient cash or requirements not met
- If owned: show “Owned” and button “Equip”

3) Shop economy rules
- Purchases subtract from cash immediately.
- Items are permanent once purchased.
- Items can be equipped/unequipped freely.
- Cosmetic only (no hidden modifiers).

4) Anti-frustration
- Allow sorting:
  - Price low→high
  - Rarity
  - Owned first
- Clear feedback:
  - toast: “Purchased: [Item]”
  - toast: “Equipped: [Item]”
  - error: “Insufficient funds” / “Career level required”

--------------------------------------------
D) ITEM CATALOG (STARTER SET)
--------------------------------------------

Implement a starter catalog (at least 24 items) with escalating prices and career gates.
Use these examples (you can add more, but include at least these):

RARITY LEVELS:
- Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary

Watches:
1. Metro Quartz (Common) $25,000 – Junior
2. Harbor Automatic (Common) $60,000 – Junior
3. Chrono Steel (Rare) $150,000 – Associate
4. Night Dial GMT (Rare) $250,000 – Associate
5. Aurora Skeleton (Epic) $800,000 – Portfolio Manager
6. Platinum Legacy (Legendary) $2,500,000 – Senior PM

Cars:
1. Compact Street (Common) $120,000 – Junior
2. Executive Sedan (Rare) $450,000 – Associate
3. Grand Touring Coupe (Epic) $1,800,000 – Portfolio Manager
4. Track Hyper (Legendary) $7,500,000 – Fund Partner

Art:
1. Minimal Horizon Print (Common) $30,000 – Junior
2. Abstract Market Lines (Rare) $220,000 – Associate
3. “Volatility” Canvas Series (Epic) $950,000 – Portfolio Manager

Office:
1. Walnut Desk Set (Common) $40,000 – Junior
2. Neon Ticker Sign (Rare) $180,000 – Associate
3. Marble Sculpture (Epic) $1,200,000 – Portfolio Manager
4. Private Office Upgrade (Legendary) $5,000,000 – Senior PM

Add additional items to reach 24+ total:
- duplicates with different names/prices
- keep everything fictional

IMPORTANT:
- Prices must be high enough that buying luxury feels like a goal.
- Early items must be attainable within a few sessions.

--------------------------------------------
E) TITLES & CAREER LEVELS
--------------------------------------------

Define titles linked to career levels (shown on Profile):
- Junior Trader: “Junior Trader”
- Associate: “Associate Broker”
- Portfolio Manager: “Portfolio Manager”
- Senior PM: “Senior Portfolio Manager”
- Fund Partner: “Fund Partner”

Optional: add “style titles” unlocked by play patterns (no purchase required), e.g.:
- “Risk Taker” (uses leverage often)
- “Steady Hands” (low drawdown streak)
(Only if easy; otherwise skip for MVP.)

--------------------------------------------
F) OPTIONAL: VISUAL INTEGRATION IN 3D OFFICE (LIGHTWEIGHT)
--------------------------------------------

If the 3D office scene exists:
- Show a simple representation of equipped items:
  - Art: change a “frame” texture/color on wall
  - Office: add a small desk prop color variant
  - Car/Watch: show as icon on monitor or shelf object
Keep it simple—do not block shipping if this is hard.

--------------------------------------------
G) DATA MODEL & PERSISTENCE
--------------------------------------------

Add a “playerProfile” structure:
- name: string
- tagline: string
- equipped: { watchId, carId, artId, officeId }
- ownedItemIds: string[]
- careerLevel: enum
- reputation, fundSize, etc. (existing)

Persist via localStorage:
- owned items
- equipped items
- name/tagline

Include a “Reset Cosmetics” option in Settings:
- clears owned/equipped items only (with confirmation)

--------------------------------------------
H) IMPLEMENTATION QUALITY
--------------------------------------------

- Keep code modular:
  - src/shop/catalog.ts (item list)
  - src/shop/shopLogic.ts (purchase/equip)
  - src/ui/profile.ts
  - src/ui/shop.ts
- Use strict checks:
  - cannot purchase if not enough cash
  - cannot purchase if career gate not met
  - cannot equip if not owned
- Provide clean UI states:
  - disabled buttons
  - clear toasts/messages
  - no layout overflow on mobile

DELIVERABLE
- A working Profile screen
- A working Shop screen
- Purchase and equip flows
- Persistent ownership/equipment
- No gameplay advantages from items
- No breaking changes to trading/idle systems
