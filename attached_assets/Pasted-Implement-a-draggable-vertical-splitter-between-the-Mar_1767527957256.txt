Implement a draggable vertical splitter between the Market and Trade columns so the user can resize the panels horizontally (especially on mobile).

CURRENT ISSUE:
On small screens, the fixed two-column layout causes the Trade panel (Buy/Sell) to be partially off-screen.

GOAL:
Allow the user to drag the column divider to give more space to Trade, without switching to a separate swipe/tab view.

REQUIREMENTS:

1) Layout Refactor (Resizable Columns)
- Wrap Market + Splitter + Trade in a parent container.
- Use CSS grid or flexbox with a CSS variable controlling Market width:
  - Example: --marketWidth: 45%;
  - Market width = var(--marketWidth)
  - Trade width = calc(100% - var(--marketWidth) - splitterWidth)

2) Splitter Handle
- The divider line becomes a draggable handle:
  - width: 12–16px (easy to grab)
  - visually shows a thin line in center + subtle “grip” dots
  - cursor: col-resize on desktop
- On mobile, handle must be finger-friendly.

3) Drag Interaction
- Support mouse drag (desktop) and touch drag (mobile).
- On drag:
  - compute new market width in pixels or percent relative to container width
  - update --marketWidth in real-time
- Add clamping:
  - Market min: 20%
  - Market max: 70%
  - (so Trade always has enough room for Buy/Sell)

4) Persistence
- Save the chosen width in localStorage (e.g. “ui.marketWidth”).
- Load it on startup.

5) Mobile Defaults & Safety
- On screens <= 820px:
  - default market width should be smaller (e.g. 32–40%) so Trade is usable.
- Ensure no horizontal page scrolling:
  - body { overflow-x: hidden; }
- Ensure Buy/Sell buttons remain fully visible within Trade panel width.

6) Optional Collapse (Nice-to-have)
- Add a double-tap or small button on the splitter to collapse/expand Market:
  - collapsed market width: 0% (or 10% peek)
  - expanded restores last width
- This is optional, implement only if quick.

DELIVERABLE:
- A reliable resizable splitter that works on mobile and desktop.
- Trade panel must always be reachable and fully visible after resizing.
- Keep existing UI and logic unchanged besides layout.
