Add a proper Title Screen and a guided Tutorial Day to the existing stock broker simulator project.

CRITICAL:
- Do NOT reset saves automatically.
- Add a “New Game” option that can start a fresh save (with confirmation).
- Keep all companies/tickers and market data fictional.
- Keep the current UI and gameplay loop intact; only add title screen + tutorial flow.

1) TITLE SCREEN (Main Menu)
Create a full-screen Title Screen shown on first load (before entering the trading desk).

Title Screen layout:
- Game title: “Market Desk Simulator” (or “Market Desk” if shorter fits)
- Subtitle: “A fictional broker day-by-day portfolio simulator”
- Buttons:
  - “Continue” (only enabled if a save exists)
  - “New Game”
  - “Tutorial”
  - “Settings”
  - “Credits”
- Small disclaimer text at bottom:
  “All companies and market data are fictional.”

Buttons behavior:
- Continue:
  - Loads existing save and goes directly to the Trading Desk (day loop).
- New Game:
  - Shows confirmation modal:
    “Start a new game? This will overwrite your current save.”
  - If confirmed, reset state to day 1 defaults, then enter Trading Desk.
- Tutorial:
  - Starts the guided tutorial flow (Tutorial Day 0/1).
- Settings:
  - Opens a simple modal with toggles:
    - Sound on/off
    - Haptics on/off (if applicable)
    - Sandbox mode on/off (optional; if already exists keep it)
- Credits:
  - Simple modal text.

2) TUTORIAL DAY (Guided Onboarding)
Add a step-by-step tutorial overlay that guides the player through core actions.

Tutorial requirements:
- The tutorial should be interactive, not just text.
- Use a dimmed overlay with a highlighted UI element (spotlight effect) and a tooltip bubble.
- Provide “Next” and “Skip Tutorial” controls.
- If user skips, tutorial is marked completed and never forces again (but can be re-launched from Title Screen).

Tutorial flow (steps):
Step 1: Welcome
- Highlight the Top Bar.
- Explain: Day, Cash, Portfolio, Total, Reputation, Career Level.

Step 2: Market List
- Highlight the Market panel.
- Instruction: “Tap a stock to view details.”

Step 3: Stock Details
- After selecting a stock, highlight the Trade panel.
- Explain price, daily change, and the chart.

Step 4: Place a Buy
- Highlight Quantity input and Buy button.
- Instruction: “Set quantity to 5 and press Buy.”
- Gate progression: only allow Next after a buy order is executed.

Step 5: Understand Position
- Highlight “Your Position” section.
- Explain shares owned, average cost, and position value.

Step 6: End the Day
- Highlight the “End Day” button.
- Explain that prices update at end of day and news impacts returns.
- Gate: only proceed after ending the day.

Step 7: End-of-Day Summary
- On End-of-Day modal, highlight Daily P/L and Best/Worst performer.
- Explain reputation change.
- Instruction: “Press Start Day 2 to continue.”

Tutorial completion:
- Mark tutorial as completed in localStorage.
- After completion, user proceeds into normal gameplay.
- Add a small option in Settings: “Reset Tutorial”.

3) TUTORIAL MARKET BEHAVIOR (Controlled Day)
To make the tutorial clear and rewarding:
- During Tutorial Day 1 only:
  - Ensure the selected stock used in the tutorial experiences a noticeable move next day (e.g., +2% to +6%).
  - Keep other stocks normal.
- Ensure the player sees a meaningful change in portfolio value to understand the loop.

4) FILE STRUCTURE / IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
- Implement a simple “screen state” router:
  - "title" | "game" | "tutorial"
- Store:
  - hasSave
  - tutorialCompleted
  - settings (sound/haptics/etc.)
- Keep the 3D scene loaded only for the game screen; title screen can be a separate UI layer.

5) QUALITY
- Make the title screen look polished and consistent with current dark theme.
- Buttons should be large and mobile-friendly.
- Ensure everything works on mobile viewport.
- Add keyboard/mouse support on desktop where relevant.

Deliver:
- Updated code with Title Screen + Tutorial flow working end-to-end.
- Ensure “Continue” works and tutorial does not break existing saves.
- Update README with how to start tutorial and reset tutorial/save.
